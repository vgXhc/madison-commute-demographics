# Prelude

I'll be using the CTPPr package to access data from the Census Transportation Planning Products. 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(CTPPr)

```
First, I have to identify the relevant tables. I'm interested in means of transportation to work by race/ethnicity and by income. The `ctpp_tables` command provides an interactive way to identify the right tables. 
```{r identify-tables}
ctpp_tables()
```
However, I don't find this terribly user friendly and would rather use the CTPP [table browser](http://data5.ctpp.transportation.org/ctpp1216/Browse/browsetables.aspx).

It appears the two relevant tables are:

- `B102201` - Minority Status (3) by Means of Transportation (11) (Workers 16 years and over) 
- `B103203` - Household income in the past 12 months (2016 $) (26) by Means of transportation (11) (Workers 16 years and over in households)

For the latter, there is also "B103202 - Median Household Income in the last 12 months (2016 $) (1) by Means of Transportation (11) for Workers (Workers 16 years and over in households) - Large Geos Only" -- it's not clear what the difference is, and I will have to do some data exploration.

```{r download-data}
minority_commute <- download_ctpp(
  id = "B102201",
  dataset = "2016",
  geography = "City",
  state = "Wisconsin",
  output = "Name" #actual names
)
```

Filter to only include Madison:
```{r}
minority_commute_msn <- minority_commute %>% 
  filter(RESIDENCE == "Madison city, WI; Madison, WI Metro Area")
```

Minority status is dichotomized into non-Hispanic White and everyone else:
```{r}
unique(minority_commute_msn$`Minority Status 3`)
```
Commute mode share is split into
```{r}
unique(minority_commute_msn$`Means of Transportation 11`)
```
The table reports absolute numbers, which isn't super helpful:
```{r}
minority_commute_msn %>% 
  filter(`Means of Transportation 11` == "Bicycle") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = `Minority Status 3`, y = Estimate)) +
  geom_col()
```

To get to percentages, we have to divide the estimates for each minority status by their respective totals. This requires the data to be wider.

```{r}
x <- minority_commute_msn %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "Minority Status 3", 
              values_from = c("Estimate", "SE"),
              id_cols = "Means of Transportation 11")
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
